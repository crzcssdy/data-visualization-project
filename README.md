# Project 3: Data Visualization

# Overview

## Background
Fertility rates and population growth/decline are critical indicators of demographic trends that shape societies worldwide. As nations navigate economic, social, and environmental challenges, these rates have varied significantly, reflecting cultural norms, access to healthcare, global events, and government policies. Our project aims to visualize global population trends over the last 40 years with the goal of identifying factors which impact the generally perceived downward trend in overall population. We aim to highlight some of the realities of the current population demographics, and birth rates to provide some idea of future global trends.

## Data Source
For our analysis, we primarily used the dataset “Health Nutrition and Population Statistics” provided by the World Bank Group, available publicly on their Databank website.
We chose this dataset specifically because it utilized the most robust set of variables and indicators which aligned closely with our visualization and analysis goals.


## Interaction


# Ethical Considerations
In developing this data visualization project, we were committed to upholding the highest ethical standards. We  prioritized transparency by using publically available datasets provided by the World Bank, clearly documenting our methodologies, and any assumptions made during analysis. We recognize the potential impact of our work and remain dedicated to promoting responsible data usage, fostering trust, and encouraging informed decision-making.

# Acknowledgments
data_visualization_project was created as an assignment for the University of California, Irvine Data Analytics Bootcamp - June 2024 Cohort under the instruction and guidance of Melissa Ingle (Instructor) and Mitchell Stone (TA). The practical exercises and coding examples demonstrated through the bootcamp helped inform and inspire the code for this project.
